Thanks to all of the CSWN and Purdue Hackers members who attended! :)

## Running the server

1. Run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to start the server.

Accessible at `localhost:3005`.

## Your next steps
* Refactor and improve file structure (see TODOs in `index.js`)
* Style the front-end
* Introduce a file-watcher such as `nodemon` that restarts your server automatically when you make changes
